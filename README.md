## Description

   "AS A manager
   I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
   SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles"-
    
   With this request in mind, this app was developed to do just that.
   This app will ask the user about the employee's on their team.
   They input answers using the terminal, an HTML file is generated with employee profiles in a clean looking card layout.

    ## Installation
   -npm init
   -npm install inquirer

  ## Usage
   This app is a great way to quickly and easily create profiles for members of a team.
   The user only has to answer a series of questions about the employee and the program will save the information that is input.
   The user answers the following:
    -Employee's Role (Manger, Engineer, Intern)
    -First Name
    -Last Name
    -Employee ID
    -Office Number (Manger selected Role)
    -Github Username (Engineer selected Role)
    -School (Intern selected role)
    -Add Another Employee
  
   Once the user is done adding employee's an HTML document is created, once opened in the browser the user will have an organized layout of all the employees on the team with      clean cards with the employee's information.
