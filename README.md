## Description

    -"AS A manager
    I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
    SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles"-
    
    With this request in mind, this app was developed to do just that.
    This app will ask the user about the employee's on their team.
    They input answers using the terminal, an HTML file is generated with employee profiles in a clean looking card layout.
